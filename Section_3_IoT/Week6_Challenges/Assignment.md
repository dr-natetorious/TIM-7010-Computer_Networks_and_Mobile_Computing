- What is the impact of the problem? That is, how are the victims (field of study, researchers, practitioners, industry, civilians, etc.) negatively affected by the problem, when is the problem evident, and where does the issue exist or become obvious? Provide an example of the problem in action or as experienced by those affected by it. Support the impact of the problem with at least three recent references.
