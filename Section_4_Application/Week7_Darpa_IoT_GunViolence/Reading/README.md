Fahmideh, M; Zowghi, D [compared](SmartCity_Arch.pdf) the architectual differences of various smart city designs.

- British Standard Institute (BSI): Emphasizes the role of governance, culture, business model innovation, and use of city services.
- Technology Strategy Board (TSB): A key concern is citiesâ€™ visions on environmental sustainability

of city governance and service.
  - Heavy focus on CityGML, IndoorGML, and Augmented Reality Markup Language
  - XML + REST everywhere big focus on interop
- FIWARE/Open Agile Smart Citites: European Commissions focusing on realtime context information and developer friendly common APIs
- IBM: Instrumented, Interconnected, and Intelligent architecture for developers to create city services for inhabitants.
- ISO/IEC 30182: Defines notions of organizations, place, metric, service, resource and their relationships.
- Service-Oriented Architecture Model (SOA): Holistic design for integrating systems such as autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and intelligent traffic management
- Cisco: Standardizes concepts and terminologies associated with IoT. Defines collaboration, abstractions, connectivity, and controllers.
