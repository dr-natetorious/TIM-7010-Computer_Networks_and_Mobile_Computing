## Part A

Imagine you are a junior researcher at a world-renowned, high-tech laboratory. The senior scientist asks that you critique and replicate an experiment within the software defined networking, mobile computing, or Internet of Things domain to demonstrate your research and technical prowess to the group. They have not specified which experiment to analyze; however, they stipulate that it must be found within a peer-reviewed publication within the last ten years and ask that you produce a short report presenting your critique and experience replicating the experiment.

First, locate a research study that contains a reproducible experiment taking the time and resource constraints of the course into consideration.

Second, analyze the original study and address the items described below:

- Describe the problem addressed. Why is it important? Is this an agreed-upon problem?
- Describe what was accomplished by the study. What was not achieved?
- Describe the methodology the study utilized. Was it appropriate? Justify.
- Describe the study results and the contribution it made to the body of knowledge, if any.
- Describe possible extensions to the research, if any. In what ways can the study be enhanced or modified to provide additional value? Discuss any limitations or assumptions held within the study and how they can be addressed.
- Present the study’s experiment that will be reproduced. Be sure to outline the setup and resources utilized.
- Describe how you will reproduce the experiment. How does your experiment differ from the original? In what ways were they the same? How do your results compare with the original results, and what conclusions can be drawn with the additional data provided by your experiment?
- Finally, reproduce the experiment and document the setup, procedure, and results. Create any tables, graphs, raw results, or aggregate reports that would allow for direct comparison with the original study.

Ensure that your critique is comprehensive and meets the quality expectations of doctoral-level work.

References: Included a minimum of five scholarly resources

Length: 5-7 pages, not include title and reference pages

## Part B

Very frequently, new research and ideas are presented in the form of posters. This serves as a way for the presenter to both convey their idea, but importantly receive feedback as well. Your next task for the week is to create a poster presenting your idea. Begin by reviewing this week’s resources on how to create a poster and be sure to follow the guidelines as discussed in these resources. You should then record a brief (2-5 minute) recording of you presenting your idea using your poster.
