# Instructions

Imagine you are a junior researcher at a world-renowned, high-tech laboratory that receives millions of dollars in government grants each year. You have been assigned the task of writing a proposal for the DARPA-BAA-15-54 research grant from the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that will focus on a topic within the software defined networking, mobile computing, Internet of Things, or related domains.

Your proposal must be in APA format, contain at least ten academic references, and be of the quality expected of doctoral-level work. The proposal may be an extension of a previously written problem-statement paper that intrigues you (and is research-worthy) or a completely new topic derived from the readings and research. If in doubt, please share your idea with the professor and request feedback.

Write a ten-page research proposal (not including the title page, table of contents, and reference list) that contains the elements listed below:

- Title Page
  - Title: The title of your work should be concise and describe what your research will entail.
  - Student Name
  - Course ID and Name
  - University
  - Date
- Table of Contents
- Background
  This section will provide enough information so that the reader understands the general context, settings, and basis for the proposed research. A non-expert may read the proposal, so ensure there is sufficient framing and discussion of the underlying concepts.
- Problem Statement
  This section will focus on the presentation of a literature-supported, open research question or problem that must be addressed. Additional areas should include detailed discussions of its scope, nature, what the problem is, how it developed or evolved into a problem, why it is a problem, and a brief discussion as to the other works that establish it as a problem within the literature.
- Goal
  This section provides a concise definition of the goal of the study, what it will accomplish, and how it will be measured. That is, how you will define success and failure of the study (if applicable).
- Relevance and Significance
  This section provides additional support for the problem statement and goal by discussing why the problem exists, who is affected by it, and the impact of the problem. Additionally, discussion of the studyâ€™s significance, the promise of its outcome, and its outcomes will address the stated problem.
- Literature Review
  This section will focus on clearly identifying the major areas that the research will focus on to establish a foundation of the study within the body of knowledge. The presentation of literature is an expansion of an annotated bibliography that justifies the problem, hypothesis, impact, and significance of the study.
- Approach
  A detailed explanation of how the study will be undertaken and how the goal will be achieved. This should take the form of a discussion of the methodology used, each step, milestone, and an explanation of each. Ensure that the approach is supported by the literature, as it cannot be based solely on opinion or experience.
- Threats and Hurdles
  What threats (both technical and non-technical) will your resource be faced with? How will you plan on mitigating these challenges as they arise? What resources can you use to mitigate these threats?
-References

For the second part of your assignment, you should create a brief (3-5 minute) video based on your proposal. Create the video as if you were having a conversation with your colleagues trying to convince them of your idea. Be sure to speak clearly, and definitively and concisely make your points. This video should touch on each of the primary areas discussed on your paper.

Length: 10-12 pages, not including title and reference pages

Video Length: 3-5 minutes, uploaded as a .mp4

Your assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts that are presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect graduate-level writing and APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
