Authors: Ravi Kiran Varma P, Kotari Prudvi Raj, and K. V. Subba Raju

This article compares the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms in detecting malware based on the permissions that are requested.

The article came up during the [TIM 8101-Principals of Computing Week8](https://github.com/dr-natetorious/TIM-8101-Principals_of_Computer_Science/tree/master/Week8_Capstone) -- and by using the signalf from multiple algorithms detects between 98.5 to 99.9% accuracy.
