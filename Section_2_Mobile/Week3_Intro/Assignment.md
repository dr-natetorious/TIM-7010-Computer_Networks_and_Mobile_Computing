As with most areas of computing, security in mobile computing is a paramount concern. This includes securing the user’s information on the mobile device, encrypting the information during the transmission of the data to the server, and securely storing this information on the backend server. Security vulnerabilities in mobile computing may not only affect a user’s perception of an app, but may also leave an organization open to legal and ethical dilemmas.

One manner in which mobile apps provide security and privacy to a user is through their use of permissions. On both Android and iOS devices, permissions protect an app from accessing sensitive information or functionality—such as reading SMS messages, accessing a user’s contacts, or placing phone calls. App permissions have received a significant level of research in recent years from a variety of perspectives, including user comprehension of permissions and using permissions to properly protect against malicious software.

An older, but still very popular, work available in the NCU ACM Library is titled “Android Permissions Demystified.” Please read this work, included in this week’s Books and Resources, to understand some of the primary challenges related to mobile permissions and security. Your task for this week is to use the NCU Library and find a recent (published within the past two years) work that discusses any area of mobile permissions, including user perception/compression, malware protection, updated permission models, or best practices. In your analysis of this work, you should include the following:

- What is the significance of the problem this work is attempting to address?
- What is the process this work uses to address the issue?
- What are some improvements/future work you would propose?
- What are some challenges to making these improvements?
- What are some related works to this topic, and how do they differ from the analyzed work?

Length: 5-7 pages not including title page and references

Your assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
