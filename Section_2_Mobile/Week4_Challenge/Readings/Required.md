## Analysing and enhancing business processes and IT-systems for mobile workforce automation: a framework approach (2007)

Authors: Gruhn and Kohler

Mobile B2E-applications (business-to-employee) can add significant value to a company's business, when large workforce divisions are involved in the execution of certain business processes. From a technical point of view, the major issues are solved (e.g. solutions for connectivity, broadband mobile networks, synchronization mechanisms, secure protocols etc.). But from a business point of view there is a lack of methodology regarding the alignment of technical solutions to the business needs. As companies face a continuously faster change in business models, legal constraints and customer needs, highly flexible systems are needed to react to changing business processes. Furthemore, the introduction of new mobile systems is often a technology-driven process, pushing the alignment of software and systems to the highly specific, fast changing business needs into the background. This paper introduces a framework summarizing the findings from earlier research and case studies related to this topic. The framework consists of a general reference process for mobile work and of a model explaining influencing factors, optimization goals and their relationships for mobile processes. The framework can be applied for process modeling, simulation and optimization as well as for requirements analysis and return on investment calculations.

## Balancing strategic interests and technological requirements for mobile services (2004)

Authors: Haaker, T., Faber, E., & Bouwman, H

Designing business models for mobile services is a complex undertaking because it requires multiple actors to balance different design requirements. A business model can be seen as a blueprint of four interrelated components or domains: service, technology, organization and finance domain. Little attention has been paid to how these different domains are related to one another. This knowledge is needed to enhance our understanding of what constitutes a viable business model. In this paper the interdependencies between two of these domains, namely organization and technology domain, are explored by analyzing critical design issues in business models for mobile services, i.e. partner selection, network openness, network governance, and network complexity in the organization domain, and security, quality of service, management of service profiles, system integration and accessibility in the technology domain. A causal framework is developed, which links these critical design issues to expected network value and business model viability.

## Does the iPad Add Value to Business Environments (2012)

Authors: Hess and Jung

Mobile tablets like the iPad recently had a huge success in the consumer market. This generates the demand to use them productively in business environments. The
underlying case study evaluates the introduction of iPads at an applied research company. The study gives evidence that the iPad adds value to this particular
business environment especially in terms of productivity and joy of use. A detailed composition of benefits and drawbacks shows major factors that have to be considered when thinking about introducing and integrating iPads to a business environment.
