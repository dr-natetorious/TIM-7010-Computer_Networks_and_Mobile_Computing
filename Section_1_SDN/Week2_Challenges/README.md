## Theme of the week

For the first part of this weekâ€™s material, we will make sure that you are familiar with a basic concept of networking: [the open systems interconnection (OSI) model](Readings/OSI). Network communication does not happen by magic; it requires several layers and components in order to ensure that data is efficiently and effectively transported across frequently vast distances. This is done by using the OSI model. There are seven layers that comprise the OSI model:

|Layer # | Layer Name | Examples| Description|
|--------|----------  | ---------| ----------|
|7|Application| SSH and FTP| Provides the interface between the software running on the device and the network protocol|
|6|Presentation| HTTP and SNMP |  Responsible for packet forwarding and routing through intermediate routers|
|5|Session|RPC and NamedPipes| Provides process to process communications between two or more networked devices|
|4|Transport|TCP and UDP|Transfers data between various systems and hosts|
|3|Network|IP|Provides switching and routing functionality between connected devices|
|2|Data Link|Ethernet|A link between two directly connected nodes. Detects and corrects errors transmitted from the physical layer|
|1|Physical Link|Cat-5|Defines the connection between the physical device and its connection mechanism|

Now that you are familiar with the OSI model, we can move onto more advanced topics in computer networking. As with most technical areas, software defined networks are constantly evolving and frequently encounter unique and sometimes difficult challenges. As a leader in technology, it will frequently be up to you to properly address and mitigate these challenges. Technical, personnel and business challenges are just some of the hurdles you may need to overcome.

This week, you will continue the research of software defined networks by identifying and critically analyzing the challenges, issues, and open research questions that exist within its development, implementation, and application.

Be sure to review this week's resources carefully. You are expected to apply the information from these resources when you prepare your assignments.
