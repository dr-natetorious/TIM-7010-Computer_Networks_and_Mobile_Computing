## SDWN Opportunities and Challenges for Internet-of-Things: A Review (2016)

Between 2016 and 2020, IoT devices are expected to increase from 9 to 24 billion devices. This explosion in devices will introduce challenges for network control systems. Each of these devices will produce data and overly saturate networks that have not properly planned for this scenario.

They argue that traditional networks will be insufficient to reach the required scalability due to the expected overhead. This will require service providers to transition toward alternatives, like SDN, as a requirement to stay competitive.

1. SDN can provide intelligent routing, reducing conjestion.
2. SDN can be tightly integrated within IoT standards, enabling better protocols.
3. SDN can standardize metrics and improve visibility into systems.
4. SDN based algorithms already support traffic analysis to improve data collection.
5. SDWN can be elastically provisioned for agility.

### Challenges within SDWN

1. The concept is fresh off the presses, there's a lot of unexplored area.
2. Detect and Debug failures in large scale networks -- e.g. see W3 debugger.
3. Association of users with access points -- e.g. see Odin tool.
    - Single controller
    - Difficult to assess real time metrics during placement (e.g. load)
4. Fail over scenarios and reliability (e.g. video streaming).
5. Integration with device management systems.
6. Support for native quality of service solutions.
7. There is a maxflow challenge with not overloading each switch.
8. Integration with legacy systems.
9. Dynmaically scaling spectrum and power at base stations, to reduce energy costs.
10. Scalability of Flow Tables (expensive and power hungry TCAM)
11. Interop with existing security products
12. Bandwidth is finite, compression algorithms are needed
13. Integration with the `Web of Things` -- everything is web endpoint.

## From Raw Data to Smart Manufacturing: AI and Semantic Web of Things for Industry 4.0 (2018)

The Web-of-Things referes to the fourth industrial revolution, that is expected from the unlocking of big data. This overlaps with the [Mangnus Frodigh KeyNote during ICSE](https://github.com/dr-natetorious/TIM-8101-Principals_of_Computer_Science/blob/master/Week5_Conferences/ICSE.docx). The direct link to that video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpeMmMh7Syk).

Both presenters discuss the criticality of Industrial IoT and the wireless challenges that these systems will require. Consider the bandwidth and how a lack of QoS from cause safety systems to become unreliable.
